# 🥗 Diet Recommendation System

This project is a machine learning-based **Diet Recommendation System** that suggests personalized diet plans using user data and nutritional datasets. It leverages unsupervised learning (KNN with cosine similarity) and robust preprocessing to match individuals with suitable food options, promoting healthy eating habits.

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 Unsupervised learning approach (KNN + Cosine Similarity)  
- 📏 Nutrient data scaled using **RobustScaler**  
- 🔍 Identifies and recommends food items based on nutrient similarity  
- 📉 Visual analysis using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  
- 🥦 Helps users discover balanced diets tailored to their needs

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3**  
- **scikit-learn** (KNN, preprocessing)  
- **NumPy**, **pandas**  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
